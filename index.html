    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <!-- Add pics that tell story about me -->
    <p>I am from Manchester originally but currently live in Leeds. 
        I am currently working for Leeds City Council as an IT support assistant.
    </p>
    <p>I first got into code from my Computer Science GCSE, however I didn't pursue it again until after university.
        Using Codecadamy and other online resources I began to learn Python. This then led me to a coding course from MCRCodes! 
    Developing my skills in HTML and CSS has led me to creating this page. It ain't much but it's mine!
    </p>

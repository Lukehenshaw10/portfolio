    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am from Manchester originally but currently live in Leeds. 
        I am currently working for Leeds City Council as an IT support assistant.
    </p>
    <p>I first got into code from my Computer Science GCSE, however I didn't pursue it again until after university.
        Using Codecadamy and other online resources I began to learn Python. This then led me toa coding course from MCRCodes! </p>
